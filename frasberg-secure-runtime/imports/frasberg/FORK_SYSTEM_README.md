# Frasberg Fork System v1.0.0

Complete documentation for the Frasberg Fork System - a framework for domain-specific AI agent extensions with strict scope boundaries.

## Overview

The Fork System enables Frasberg to operate safely in specialized domains (education, healthcare) while maintaining absolute boundaries around prohibited capabilities.

- Patient safety regulations

**Personas:**
- Administrative Assistant
- Patient Navigator
- Health Educator (general only)
- Appointment Scheduler

- Multi-layer scope enforcement
- Mandatory medical disclaimers

**Emergency Resources:**
- Medical Emergency: 911
- Suicide/Crisis: 988
- Poison Control: 1-800-222-1222

## Key Components

### Domain Scope Documents

Each fork has a detailed scope document (`domain/scope.md`) that defines:
- Exact in-scope capabilities
- Strictly prohibited actions
- Disclosure requirements
- Ethical boundaries
- Compliance requirements
- Human-in-the-loop requirements
- Technical implementation details

### Policy Enforcement

Policy engines (`domain/policies.py`) provide:
- Real-time request validation
- Keyword-based detection
- Pattern matching for violations
- Immediate rejection of out-of-scope requests
- Audit logging
- Escalation protocols

### Personas

Domain-specific personas (`domain/personas.py`) include:
- Role definitions
- Capability boundaries
- Automatic disclosure generation
- Age/context-appropriate adaptations
- Risk level awareness

### Disclosures

Required disclosure templates (`domain/disclosures.md`) ensure:
- Transparency about AI capabilities
- Clear limitation communication
- Appropriate emergency resources
- Age-appropriate messaging
- Compliance with regulations

### Simulations

Safe testing environments (`simulation/*.py`) provide:
- Domain-specific scenarios
- No real user data
- Policy validation
- Scope integrity testing

## Deployment Modes

### Standard Deployment
- Full network access
- Automatic updates
- Standard monitoring

### Restricted Deployment
- Internal network only
- Manual updates with verification
- Internal monitoring only

### Air-Gapped Deployment
- **Complete network isolation**
- Manual updates via physical media
- Local monitoring only
- Network isolation validator required

**Air-Gap Configuration:**
```python
from backend.app.deployment.airgap import create_full_airgap_config

config = create_full_airgap_config(
    deployment_id='secure-facility-001',
    local_model_path='/opt/frasberg/models',
    local_data_path='/opt/frasberg/data',
    allowed_internal_ips=['10.0.0.0/8']
)
```

**Validation:**
```python
from backend.app.deployment.airgap import validate_airgap_deployment

is_compliant, report = validate_airgap_deployment(strict_mode=True)
print(report)
```

## CI/CD Fork Guard

The Fork Guard workflow (`.github/workflows/fork-guard.yml`) ensures:

1. **Fork Isolation:** Fork branches can ONLY modify files in their fork directory
2. **Core Protection:** Fork branches cannot modify core system files
3. **Structure Validation:** Enforces required fork directory structure
4. **Scope Enforcement:** Verifies policy enforcement code exists

**Usage:**
- Create fork branches as: `fork/education/*` or `fork/healthcare/*`
- Fork Guard automatically validates all PRs
- Violations block merge

## Testing

### Scope Integrity Tests

Each fork includes comprehensive scope integrity tests:

**Education:**
```bash
pytest forks/education/tests/test_scope_integrity.py -v
```

**Healthcare:**
```bash
pytest forks/healthcare-nonclinical/tests/test_nonclinical_scope.py -v
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Policy enforcement
- Persona boundaries
- Disclosure delivery
- Compliance requirements
- Safety feature validation

## Security

### Isolation Layers

1. **Fork-to-Fork:** Complete isolation - forks cannot access each other
2. **Fork-to-Core:** Read-only - forks cannot modify core
3. **Core-to-Fork:** Controlled - core manages fork lifecycle

### Data Protection

**Education Fork:**
- No access to FERPA-protected student records
- No student PII storage
- Privacy-first design

**Healthcare Fork:**
- Zero access to PHI (Protected Health Information)
- No medical record access
- HIPAA-compliant by design

### Audit Logging

All systems log:
- Policy violations
- Escalations
- Scope boundary attempts
- Emergency situations

## Usage Examples

### Education Fork

```python
from forks.education.domain.personas import get_persona
from forks.education.domain.policies import get_policy_engine

# Get a persona
persona = get_persona("student_support_high")
disclosure = persona.get_disclosure()

# Validate a request
policy_engine = get_policy_engine()
is_valid, violation = policy_engine.validate_request(
    "Can you help me understand quadratic equations?"
)

if is_valid:
    # Process request
    pass
else:
    # Show violation message to user
    print(violation.user_message)
```

### Healthcare Fork

```python
from forks.healthcare_nonclinical.domain.personas import get_persona
from forks.healthcare_nonclinical.domain.policies import get_healthcare_policy_engine

# Get a persona
persona = get_persona("administrative_assistant")
safety_disclosure = persona.get_safety_disclosure()

# Validate a request (STRICT enforcement)
policy_engine = get_healthcare_policy_engine()
is_valid, violation = policy_engine.validate_request(
    "Can you help me schedule an appointment?"
)

if is_valid:
    # Process administrative request
    pass
else:
    # Show safety message and escalate if needed
    print(violation.user_message)
    if violation.requires_immediate_escalation:
        # Escalate to appropriate resource
        pass
```

## Creating a New Fork

1. Create fork directory structure:
```bash
mkdir -p forks/new-domain/{domain,simulation,tests}
```

2. Create required files:
   - `domain/scope.md` - Define scope boundaries
   - `domain/disclosures.md` - Define disclosures
   - `domain/personas.py` - Create personas
   - `domain/policies.py` - Implement policy enforcement
   - `simulation/*.py` - Create simulations
   - `tests/test_*.py` - Write scope integrity tests

3. Update `system-manifest.json`

4. Create fork branch: `fork/new-domain/initial-setup`

5. Fork Guard will validate structure
