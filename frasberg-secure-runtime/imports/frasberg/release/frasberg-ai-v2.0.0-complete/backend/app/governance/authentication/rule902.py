Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 902(13)
Certification of Data Copied from an Electronic Device, Storage Medium,
or Electronic File
{'='*80}

I, {certificate.custodian_name}, {certificate.custodian_title} of 
{certificate.organization}, hereby certify as follows:

SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION:
---------------------
System Name: {certificate.system_name}
System Version: {certificate.system_version}
Record Type: {certificate.record_type.value}

RECORDS COVERED BY THIS CERTIFICATION:
-------------------------------------
Total Records: {certificate.record_count}
Date Range: {certificate.date_range_start} to {certificate.date_range_end}

FRE RULE 902(13) ATTESTATIONS:
-----------------------------
Pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 902(13), I certify that:

1. CREATED BY ELECTRONIC PROCESS OR SYSTEM:
   These records were created by the {certificate.system_name}, an electronic
   system that automatically records information without human intervention at
   the time of the event being recorded.
   
   Status: {'CERTIFIED' if certificate.created_by_system else 'NOT CERTIFIED'}

2. CREATED AT OR NEAR TIME OF OCCURRENCE:
   The system creates records contemporaneously with the events being recorded,
   using high-precision timestamps synchronized to authoritative time sources.
   
   Status: {'CERTIFIED' if certificate.created_at_occurrence_time else 'NOT CERTIFIED'}

3. MAINTAINED IN REGULAR COURSE OF BUSINESS:
   These records are maintained as part of the regularly conducted activities
   of {certificate.organization} and are kept in the ordinary course of business.
   
   Status: {'CERTIFIED' if certificate.maintained_regularly else 'NOT CERTIFIED'}

4. CREATED AS REGULAR PRACTICE:
   The creation of these records is a regular practice of the organization,
   and the system that creates them operates as part of standard business
   procedures.
   
   Status: {'CERTIFIED' if certificate.regular_practice else 'NOT CERTIFIED'}

PROCESS DESCRIPTION:
-------------------
{certificate.process_description}

ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY:
------------------------
The system employs the following methods to ensure accuracy and reliability:
"""
        
        for idx, method in enumerate(certificate.accuracy_methods, 1):
            text += f"\n{idx}. {method}"
        
        text += f"""

HASH CHAIN VERIFICATION:
-----------------------
The records include cryptographic hash values that create a tamper-evident
chain. Any modification to the records would be immediately detectable through
hash verification.

First Record Hash: {certificate.record_hashes[0] if certificate.record_hashes else 'N/A'}
Last Record Hash: {certificate.record_hashes[-1] if certificate.record_hashes else 'N/A'}

CERTIFICATION:
-------------
I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct
to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.

Executed on: {certificate.certification_date}

Certificate ID: {certificate.certificate_id}
Certificate Hash: {certificate.certificate_hash}
