## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Style

- Use **strict mode** (`strict: true` in tsconfig.json)
- No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use explicit return types for functions
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add semicolons
- Use trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: camelCase (e.g., `createFrasbergClient.ts`)
- **Classes/Interfaces**: PascalCase (e.g., `FrasbergClient`)
- **Functions/Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `loadFrasbergConfig`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `DEFAULT_API_URL`)

## Commit Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
