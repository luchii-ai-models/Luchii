🚀 New preprint! "DNA Computing Integration in Distributed Intelligence Systems"

We integrated DNA computing into a planetary-scale distributed system, achieving:
• 10^6x storage density
• 10^5x energy efficiency  
• Open-source implementation

📄 Paper: [arXiv link]
💻 Code: https://github.com/FrasbergAI/frasberg

## Reddit (r/MachineLearning)
Title: [R] DNA Computing Integration in Distributed Intelligence Systems: The Frasberg Approach

We present Frasberg, a distributed AI system integrating DNA computing principles at planetary scale. 

Key results:
- 10^6x storage density vs traditional systems
- 10^5x energy efficiency  
- Complete open-source implementation
- Production deployment

Paper: [arXiv link]
Code: https://github.com/FrasbergAI/frasberg

This is the first practical integration of DNA computing into a production distributed system. Would love your feedback!

## HackerNews
Title: DNA Computing in Distributed Systems: 1M× storage density, 100k× energy efficiency

We integrated DNA computing principles into a distributed intelligence system. The system is open-source and deployed at scale.

Highlights:
- Store 215 PB per gram (vs 1 TB for SSDs)
- 100,000× more energy efficient operations
- Parallel search across trillions of records
- Complete working implementation

## LinkedIn
I'm excited to share our latest research on integrating DNA computing into distributed systems!

Our team built Frasberg, a planetary-scale AI system that leverages biological computing principles to achieve remarkable improvements:

📊 Results:
• 1,000,000× storage density increase
• 100,000× energy efficiency gain
• First production deployment of DNA computing at scale

🔬 This demonstrates that hybrid silicon-biological systems are not just theoretical - they're practical and deployable today.

The entire system is open-source, and we've published a detailed paper explaining the architecture and benchmarks.
