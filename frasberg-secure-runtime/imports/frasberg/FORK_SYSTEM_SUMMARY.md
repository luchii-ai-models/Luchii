**Process:**
1. Detect fork branches (`fork/*`)
2. Validate only fork directory changes

## 📝 Notes

### Critical Points
- Healthcare fork is STRICTLY non-clinical
- All forks enforce mandatory disclosures
- Emergency situations trigger immediate escalation
- PHI/student records are NEVER accessed
- Human oversight is ALWAYS required for critical decisions

### Compliance
- Education: FERPA/COPPA compliant by design
- Healthcare: HIPAA compliant by design
- All policies auditable
- All violations logged

### Limitations
- AI system, NOT a replacement for professionals
- Operates ONLY within defined scope
- Requires human oversight
- Not suitable for emergencies
