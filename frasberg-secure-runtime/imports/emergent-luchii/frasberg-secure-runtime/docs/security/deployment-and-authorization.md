# Deployment and authorization boundaries

## What belongs in GitHub

This repository contains source code, API contracts, deployment templates, migrations, tests, and secret-free configuration. It must not contain production API keys, JWT secrets, service-role keys, database passwords, model weights, or live engine binaries.

## Where APIs and engines run

The gateway and runtime-router packages are deployable backend services. Real music, video, image, voice, STT, and TTS engines are external adapters or separately deployed services. Configure their URLs and credentials through the deployment platform’s secret manager; the repository includes no production-engine claim or embedded secret.

Supabase stores authenticated users, owner-scoped metadata, jobs, usage, policies, audit records, and monitoring snapshots. It is not a runtime host for GPU engines and must not be used as a secret store for engine credentials.

## Authorization for control-plane changes

Admin control-plane operations must pass all of these boundaries:

1. The gateway verifies the bearer token signature, expiry, issuer, and audience.
2. The gateway resolves the user role from trusted server-side storage rather than trusting a mutable request field.
3. Admin routes require the resolved role to be `admin`.
4. Governance updates validate thresholds through `GovernanceEngine`.
5. Mutations are recorded by the gateway audit store.
6. Database maintenance functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` plus system/admin guards; pg_cron jobs run as trusted system work, not as end users.

JWT claims may identify a subject, but an admin claim alone must not be the source of truth for production authorization. Keep role promotion in a controlled server-side workflow and audit it.

The production gateway also accepts `x-governance-key` as a narrowly scoped break-glass credential for `/v1/governance/*`. It is stored in AWS Secrets Manager and injected into the ECS task as `GOVERNANCE_ADMIN_KEY`; the ECS execution role policy scopes access to the named governance secret. This key does not authorize chat, media, audit, or other admin routes. Do not pass it in URLs, log it, or reuse it as an API key.

## Identity graph access

`/v1/identity/graph` requires a Supabase user access token in the bearer
authorization header. The gateway validates that token with Supabase Auth,
then calls owner-scoped RPCs with the same token so Postgres derives the owner
from `auth.uid()`. Clients cannot choose an `owner_id`; the graph is stored per
authenticated user. The anonymous Supabase key identifies the project and is
not sufficient to read or mutate identity data by itself.

API-key requests may include `x-api-signature`, an HMAC-SHA-256 over the
serialized JSON body using the same API key. The gateway verifies supplied
signatures with a constant-time comparison and rejects invalid signatures.
Signatures do not replace bearer API-key authentication or TLS.

## Continuity event access

`/v1/continuity/worlds/{worldId}/state` and `/events` use the same verified
Supabase user token. State updates modify only the `continuity` member of the
world's existing `world_state`. Event creation delegates ownership and
world-access checks to the existing `record_continuity_event` RPC. Event reads
use a new owner-scoped, cursor-paginated RPC with a hard maximum page size of 100. The gateway never accepts an owner ID from the client.

## Diagnostic event access

`/v1/diagnostics` accepts and returns per-user diagnostic events using the
verified Supabase user token. Records are owner-scoped, page-limited to 100,
and constrained to `info`, `warning`, or `error` severity. The gateway excludes
the database owner column from responses. Retention and deletion policy still
need an explicit product decision before the event table is enabled for
unbounded production ingestion.

## User policy access

`/v1/policy` stores and lists the authenticated user's meaning/risk thresholds;
`DELETE /v1/policy/{id}` can remove only that user's policy. `POST
/v1/policy/enforce` returns a server-evaluated decision for supplied scores.
That endpoint does not yet intercept API-key-based job submission, because
those API keys are not mapped to Supabase user identities. Do not treat its
response as a guarantee that media or chat jobs have been blocked.

## Secrets

Use the hosting platform’s environment/secrets manager for `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, JWT verification secrets, database URLs, and engine credentials. Never put these values in SQL seed data, public tables, GitHub Actions logs, or committed `.env` files.

## Validation

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run test
npm run validate:manifests
supabase db reset
supabase test db
```

The monitoring migration is optional with respect to `pg_cron`: it applies without the extension and logs a notice; enable `pg_cron` and call `call admin.install_monitoring_cron_jobs();` from a trusted deployment step to install schedules.
