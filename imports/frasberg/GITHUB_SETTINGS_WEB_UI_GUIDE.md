## Step 5: Update Existing Release Metadata (2-5 minutes)

### Why this is manual

2. Open each published release that still shows `Frasberg` or `Frasberg`
3. Click **Edit**
4. Update the title and any active branding in the release body to `Frasberg`
5. Keep historical context only if it is clearly labeled as historical

### ✅ Verification
- The Releases page shows `Frasberg` branding for active release titles
- No release title on the repository homepage still shows `Frasberg` or `Frasberg`

---

## Step 6: Rename Repository (OPTIONAL - 2 minutes)

### ⚠️ Important Notes
- This will change the repository URL
- Old URLs will redirect for a period but eventually break
- You MUST update local git remotes
- CI/CD pipelines and webhooks may break

### Instructions

1. **Navigate to Settings**
   - Go to https://github.com/FrasbergAI/frasberg/settings/general
   - Scroll to the top

2. **Find Repository Name Field**
   - You'll see a text field with the current repository name: `frasberg`

3. **Change the Name**
   - Clear the field
   - Enter the new name: `frasberg`

4. **Click "Rename"**
   - The button appears next to the name field
   - Click it to confirm
   - GitHub will process the rename

5. **Update Local Git Remote** (on your computer)

   Open terminal/command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/FrasbergAI/frasberg.git
   ```

   Verify the change:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

### ✅ Verification
- Repository URL changes to: `https://github.com/FrasbergAI/frasberg`
